# Stroke Prediction

In this project, we aimed to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on various factors such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and more.

The project consists of two main parts:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - In this part, we explored and visualized the data to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and their impact on the target variable.

Machine Learning Model - In this part, we built and trained a machine learning model using various algorithms to predict the likelihood of a stroke. We also evaluated the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics.

The data used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about 5,110 patients.

Enjoy :)

Welcome!

Project 1: Box Office - Revenue prediction EDA
In this project, I explored a dataset to gain a better understanding of its structure and characteristics. I used various visualization techniques and statistical methods to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships in the data. Through this process, I was able to identify key insights and draw meaningful conclusions that could inform further analysis or decision-making.


Project 2: Stroke Prediction - EDA and Modeling
In this project, I combined EDA with machine learning to develop a predictive model based on a given dataset. I then used various algorithms to train and test the model, evaluating its performance using the ideal metrix.
